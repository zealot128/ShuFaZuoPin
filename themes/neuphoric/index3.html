	<h2>changes.</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Width has been set to 85%</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Want it wider? Easy. In the styles.css file, do a find and replace. Swap 75 for 85, and then 73 for 83. That will get this page you are looking
	at now. It is that easy to adjust.</p>
	
	<h2>design.notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>800x600 and up (Can stretch to 2000px wide without the banner running out)</li>
		<li>valid xhtml/css</li>
		<li>looks great! (not open to subjective dispute)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I have heard a few people complaining about the lack of fluid designs. With the increase
	of larger screens and higher resolutions, some people are getting sick of looking at a small thing
	in the middle of the screen</p>
	<p>A problem with fluid designs is that once the content stretches wide, the line lengths become
	rather long, and are harder to read. Hopefully because the content on this is 75% wide, the line lengths
	do not become too wide.</p>
