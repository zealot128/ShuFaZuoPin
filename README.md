A Rails 3.1RC1 App for learning chinese language. Currently i18n only for german language, but the translations of all characters is english

This app can be used by multple users at the same time, sharing the same fundus of characters.

For pronounciation I am using the color codes proposed by my Chinese learning book Liaoliao, which are:
* blue for 1st tone
* green for 2nd tone
* yellow for 3rd tone
* red for 4th tone
for my experience, codings the hanzi characters in the respective color is effective for learning correct pronounciation.


## Todo/plans

* add multi character words
* problem-list and statistics, to find out words that are not so save in memory
* english i18n if wished (just a matter of work)
* design could be pimped
* caching if necessary (until now works fine)
* integrating 3rd party services for more information about words/character etymology and radicals

## Collaboration
* Feedback is welcome
* pull requests are very welcome :)
